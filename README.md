# Cricket-World-Cup-2022-Analysis
The project involves using Python programming language, web scraping techniques, and data manipulation libraries like pandas to extract data from the espncricinfo website.
The data is then transformed and cleaned to calculate various player performance metrics. 
Finally, a Power BI report is created to analyze the data, identify top 11 players for a T20 cricket team, and select players for different categories based on their performance metrics. 
The Power BI dashboard also helps to predict the chances of winning a match by the selected team, and in this case, it is estimated that the selected team has a 90% chance of winning.
